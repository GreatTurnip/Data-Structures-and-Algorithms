# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C/C++, as part of my Computer Science and Engineering studies at SUST.

## Folder Structure

- **Arrays:** Basic operations and array-based algorithms.
- **LinkedLists:** Singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks:** Stack implementations.
- **Queues:** Queue and priority queue implementations.
- **Trees:** Binary trees, BSTs, and related algorithms.
- **Graphs:** Graph traversal and algorithms.
- **Searching:** Searching algorithms like binary search.
- **Sorting:** Sorting algorithms like quick sort, merge sort, etc.

## Usage
Each folder contains C++ source files that can be compiled and run using:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
